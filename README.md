# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview ##
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that focuses on funding for new creative projects. Kickstarter examined over four thousands different campaigns globally with a focal point in the entainment industury (film, theater, music, games, video, and photography).
### Purpose ###
The purpose of the analysis was to assist the customer in making an informed decision on when to launch, and where to start a crowdfunding campaign. Although the platform has multiple categories, my analysis was centered around analysing trends in the theater category, specifically plays.
