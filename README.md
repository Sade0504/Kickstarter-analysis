# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview ##
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that focuses on funding for new creative projects. Kickstarter examined over four thousands different campaigns globally with a focal point in the entainment industury (film, theater, music, games, video, and photography).
### Purpose ###
The purpose of the analysis was to assist the customer in making an informed decision on when to launch, and where to start a crowdfunding campaign. Although the platform has multiple categories, my analysis was centered around analysing trends in the theater category, specifically plays. 
## Analysis and Challenges ##
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After filtering and conditional formatting the data, I created a visual summary of the data via a pivot chart that identified the best time of year to launch a specific campaign. The requested data needed is specific to theater, so the chart is filtered by the parent category and years. The months are listed is a row with outcomes (successful, canceled, and failed) going across the chart. To further illustrate the results, a line chart was created to add more strength to the data shown in the pivot chart.

### Analysis of Outcomes Bases on Goals




## Results
It was determined that the best time of the year to launch a theater campaign would be May thru July. Those months have the highest theater campaign successful rates and the fewest canceled campaigns.
